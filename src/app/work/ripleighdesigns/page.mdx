## Overview

When Leighann expressed a need to have a website for her design company, we did not hesitate to come up with the perfect solution. This started as a simple marketing website to showcase her designs and services to prospective clients, as well as provide a way for them to contact her in a manner that safeguards her personal information. While still a work in progress, we have already seen client engagement with her website, so we know we are on the right track!

Our next steps in this journey are to finalize products and information for an initial launce of the E-Commerce module, then integrate a blog where Leighann can upload periodical posts about the business and engage with customers on a more intimate level.

We also went above and beyond by providing a custom domain for her website and setting up an email with that domain so she can communicate with clients in a professional way that will really give clients a sense of professionalism.
