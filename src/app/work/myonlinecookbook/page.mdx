## Overview

Annoyed by the constant battle of keeping ingredients off of expensive cookbooks and printed recipes, Rebecca, reached out to see if we could help create an online solution for her to store her vast library of cookbooks and hand written recipes so she could access them from everywhere.

We got to work and spun up a Next.js instance and worked on creating an aesthetically pleasing UI that was easy to use and understand. After that we spun up a PostgreSQL database and worked to engineer the data types and schema to handle user and recipe information. We decided that building the API with Go was a no-brainer since it is quick and efficient and easy to simply write code in a secure and effective manner.

We specifically developed this so that we did not have to rely on online microservices and hosted solutions, so Rebecca could access her recipes even during an internet or network outage. To do this, we dockerized our database and API and hosted it on Rebecca's network with tools to manage it remotely to assist with any technical problems. We also hosted a local instance of the frontend just in case the cloud-based website was ever unreachable. This should ensure that as long as Rebecca has power, she will have access to all of her recipes.

We went above and beyond and coupled the software solutions with a robust battery backup and to ensure she can still access her recipes from her home for up to 84 hours after the losing power. To assist her business, we set up a new custom domain for her and an email address which uses that domain so she looks professional to all of her prospective clients.
